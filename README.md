In this analysis, tables are created through SQL that contain employee information with primary keys that will be used to merge their information. The code for this is found in the "Emp_SQL_Table_Schema.sql". These tables are then merged to create various views that are then scrutinized through other queries to find specific information about the employees. The code for this is found in "Employee_SQL_Queries.sql". In order to understand how the data was to be merged on the primary keys an ERD was made. This is the png image labeled "Employee_SQL_ERD". 
Along with the assigned queries, 3 additional were made. These queries are made to look at the percentage difference of men and women that work at the company, the highest earning managers at the company, and finally the amount of employees that work in each of the departments.
